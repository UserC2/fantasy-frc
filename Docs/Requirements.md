# Requirements
### Programming
* Use interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, regular classes
* \>8 properties + \>2 environmental conditions

### Features
* 2 entities face off in a "competition", one wins
* Take into account entity properties + environmental conditions when deciding which entity wins
  * Small amount of randomness is useful to make game less deterministic
* Player can configure entity properties
  * Configuration is adjustable during the game (not just on startup)
    * Potentially: Competition is interactive
* GUI is used to *configure* entities (GUI not required during the game)
* Competition progress is shown as it occurs (i.e. not all at once at the end)
* Single & two player:
  * Single: Player configures both entities
  * Two player: One player configures each entity

### Documentation
* Code & comments are of good quality
* README:
  * Describe project
  * Instructions on how to play
  * Programming instructions:
    * Dev environment setup/configuration
    * Making/submitting changes
* Track changes & progress with GitHub (or GitLab, etc...)
  * Submit pull requests to be reviewed by **the teacher**
  * \> 3 pull requests submitted to teacher
