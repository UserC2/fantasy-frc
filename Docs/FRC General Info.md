# FRC Game Info
* This is a short summary of how an FRC game works.
* More detailed information can be found in the [FRC Game Manual](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2024/Manual/2024GameManual.pdf). (2024 version linked.)

## Teams & Robots
* A team is a group of people who participate in FRC.
* Each team is allowed to submit one robot for a competition.

## Alliances
* An alliance is a group of three teams that play against another alliance during a match.
* During practice and qualification matches, alliance partners are randomly assigned.
* Before playoff matches begin, teams participate in "alliance selection", where they choose alliance partners for playoffs.
* Teams stay with the same alliance during the entirety of playoffs.

## Competition Structure
* A competition is a series of matches played by several teams.
* At the end of a competition, the winning alliance is awarded the title "Champions" and the second-place alliance is awarded the title "Finalists".

Competitions are divided into three phases:
* Practice matches
  * Teams can practice their strategy and test their robot.
* Qualification matches
  * Teams earn Ranking Points, which affect their placement in playoff matches.
* Playoff matches
  * Alliances compete to determine the winner of the competition.

## Matches
* In a match, two alliances play against each other.
* Matches are divided into "autonomous" (0:15s) and "teleop" (2:15s) sections.
  * In autonomous, the robot is preprogrammed.
  * In teleop, the robot is controlled by one or more "drivers".
* Ranking Points are awarded based on the gameplay and outcome of the match.

## Scoring
Each game has "game pieces" (some sort of object or multiple related objects) for the robot to manipulate.

Each game usually has some common scoring elements:
* High goal:
  * Awards more points, but is more difficult
* Low goal:
  * Awards less points, but is easier
* Ground pickup:
  * Game pieces are delibrately placed on the ground at the start for robots to pick up.
  * This is often quicker than station pickup, but relies on the availability of pieces on the ground, as some games do not reintroduce game pieces once they are scored.
* Station pickup:
  * A human feeds game pieces to the robot through some mechanism on the edge of the playing field.
  * Pieces are almost always available (scoring all of the pieces available is typically impractical) at the station pickup, but there is usually a limited amount of space for robots at the station, so it becomes congested quickly.

## Ranking Points (RP)
* During qualification matches, teams have the ability to gain ranking points.
* RP are gained by winning or tying a match, and also by performing certain game specific objectives.
* RP affects each robot's ranking during qualifications and alliance selection.
  * Calculation: `total RP / number of qualification matches played`

Scoring RP:
* Two RP are earned by winning a match
* One RP is earned by both alliances by tying a match
* One RP is earned by completing a scoring objective (usually a certain number of game pieces)
* One RP is earned by completing an end game objective (usually a certain number of end game points)
